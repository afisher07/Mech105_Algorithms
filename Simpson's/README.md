## Simpson's 1/3 Function
Numerical evaluation of integral by Simpson's 1/3 Rule
If there is an odd number of intervals, the trapezoidal rule will be used for the last interval

## Inputs
* x: the vector of equally spaced independent variable
* y: the vector of function values with respect to x

## Outputs:
* I: the numerical integral calculated

## Limitations
* According to the grading algorithm, the code cannot compute the correct integral estimate for a problem with more than three data points and an even number of intervals
